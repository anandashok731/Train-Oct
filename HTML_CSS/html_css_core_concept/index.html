        <p class="definition">Specificity is a weight that is applied to a given css
            declaration, determined by the number of each selector
            type in the matching selector. When multiple declarations
            have equal specificity, the last declaration found in the cssis applied to the 
            element. Specificity only applies when the same element is targeted by multiple 
            declarations. As per CSS rules, directley targeted elements will always take precedences over
            rules which an element inherits from its ancestor.
